# Chapter 2 code

## Section 2.2.2: Understand `extern` keyword

We create a global variable and let functions defined in different files to change the global variable. Run code by

```
./understand_extern.sh
```

## Section 2.3: Reference and Pointer

The most difference between reference and pointer is "there is no way to make a reference refer to a different object". 

Run code for understanding reference:

```
./reference.sh
```

Run code for understanding pointer:

```
./pointer.sh
```
